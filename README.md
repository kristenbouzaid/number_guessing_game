# Number Guessing Game 
 First Data Analyst TechDegree Project

This Unit 1 project is a Number Guessing Game in which the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. 

If you are reading this, I will share with you that this project was challenging but also very rewarding and I feel like I learned quite a bit.
